        My favorite hobby is reading books, espically non-fiction.  I find this an enjoyable hobby, as I can pass my time with it and I can learn many things from reading.  Depending on the book I read, I can learn, experience emotions, imagine, or even just get a good laugh.  This is a reason as to why reading is what I enjoy as my favorite hobby.
